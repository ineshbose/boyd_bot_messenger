# Boyd Bot (Messenger)
This repository is for Flask version of the Boyd Bot.

## Set-Up
### Packages
All requirements have been listed in `requirements.txt`, they can be installed using
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables
Access tokens, keys, etc have been hidden from this repository for obvious reasons. Wherever you see `os.environ.get()`, a key is being used. You may replace these with your own.

## To-Do
1. Read Next Class ✓
2. Locations
3. Book Rooms (might have to ditch considering `selenium` is removed)
4. Small talk(?) (Switch to DialogFlow) ✓
5. Background Scheduler (opt-in feature)

## Note
This repository was created fresh as the previous (private) repository had some keys in the commit history. If any sensitive data is pushed accidentally, a new repository will be created.
